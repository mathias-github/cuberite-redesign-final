For Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi or Mac builds, the main download location is the [official home page](https://cuberite.org), with the latest builds available. For developers who want more control over the builds they download, visit the [buildserver](https://builds.cuberite.org).

On Linux or Raspberry Pi, you can simply paste this command into your terminal to install Cuberite:

<div class="code-box">sh -c "$(wget -O - https://download.cuberite.org)"</div>

Once you have downloaded Cuberite, you can skip straight to [Running Cuberite](#running-cuberite).

Pre-compiled builds are faster to install and easier to use than compiling the source yourself, and are recommended for beginners. However, for some unusual hardware for which no pre-compiled build exists it may be necessary to compile the code yourself. Compiling yourself also has a significant performance advantage on modern machines. If you know how to use the command line or want extra speed you should [compile Cuberite yourself](#compile-cuberite-yourself).
