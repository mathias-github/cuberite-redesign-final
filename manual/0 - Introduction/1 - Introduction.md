This is the Cuberite User's Manual. It is intended as a guide on how to operate the basics of Cuberite, as well as an introduction to some advanced features. It is organised into major sections as well as more detailed subsections and these are laid out in the [Table of Contents](#manual). The first section deals with downloading, installing, and running Cuberite. The second section is an overview of configuring Cuberite. Reading those two sections is enough to get you started. The remaining sections cover more advanced features and further configuration options in greater depth.

As with Cuberite itself, this manual is in active development, and you can contribute yourself or file an issue if you find an error or ommission on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cuberite/users-manual). If you're using a printed version, note that the latest version of this manual is always available [online](/manual/).
