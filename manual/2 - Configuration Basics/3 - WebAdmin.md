The WebAdmin allows you to control various aspects of Cuberite, including player permissions. A typical ***webadmin.ini*** configuration looks like this:

[User:john]
Password=cuberiteRocks

[WebAdmin]
Ports=8080
Enabled=1

In the example above, you can login to the web admin using the username ***john*** and the password ***cuberiteRocks*** by pointing your browser to ***http://\<Server IP address\>:8080***. If you're running your server locally, point your browser to ***http://localhost:8080***.
