By default, there are three worlds: ***world***, ***world_nether***, ***world_end***. Each world can be tweaked by editing ***\<World Name\>/world.ini***. You can use this file to edit things like the spawn point location, the game mode, and the diffculty level. See [Configuring world.ini](#configuring-world-ini) for details.
