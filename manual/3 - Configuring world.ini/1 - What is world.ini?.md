It is possible to configure many different aspects of individual worlds with Cuberite. Configuration options include:

- Changing the spawn point of a world.
- Changing the game mode of a world.
- Changing the world generator, so as to change the terrain generated.
- Changing the types of plants that generate in the world.
- Changing which types of animals are allowed to spawn.
- There are many more things that can be done, and these are just examples.

All this configuration can be done through one file. It is called ***world.ini*** and can be found in each world's individual folder. When a world is first created by Cuberite, the file is filled out with default values that are fairly close to vanilla Minecraft.

The ***world.ini*** file is split into many different sections, each with a name surrounded in square brackets. For example {{3.2 - <code>[SpawnPosition]</code>}} is a section. Each section contains configuration options related to a specific feature of Cuberite.
