Hi there everyone! I have some good news to report - Cuberite now supports the 1.9 Protocol.

New builds can be downloaded from the <a href="http://cuberite.org/">homepage</a>.

Although the protocol is fully supported, not all of the new features are implemented yet. If you find a new feature that is missing, please do report it on <a href="https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/issues">GitHub</a> so we remember to implement it.

Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pokechu22">@Pokechu22</a> for all their hard work on the protocol support :)
