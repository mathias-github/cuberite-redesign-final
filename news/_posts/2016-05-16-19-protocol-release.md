Hi there everyone! I have some good news to report - Cuberite now supports the 1.9 protocol.

New builds can be downloaded from the [homepage](https://cuberite.org/).

Although the protocol is fully supported, not all of the new features are implemented yet. If you find a new feature that is missing, please do report it on [GitHub](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/issues) so we remember to implement it.

Thanks to [Pokechu22](https://github.com/Pokechu22) for all their hard work on the protocol support. :)
