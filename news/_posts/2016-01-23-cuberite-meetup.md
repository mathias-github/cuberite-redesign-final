title: 'Cuberite Meetup'
---
Hello everyone! To celebrate reaching 1000 stars in our GitHub Repository, we're arranging a meetup at a [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) in Germany. On the meetup, you will be able to learn how to write plugins for Cuberite, contribute to discussions about Cuberite's development, develop for Cuberite and more. There is an  [agenda](#) over the things to do, but it isn't finished yet. Feel free to suggest something you want to do at the meetup.

The meetup will happen on February 19-21 2016, at the address "Das Labor Alleestra√üe 50, 44793 Bochum, Germany". We will not pay for accomodation, so you'll have to find a hotel or similar nearby. If you're planning on joining the meetup, please [mark the days you will be at the meetup](http://doodle.com/poll/ywaucxvcyzstt36z).
