title: 'Cuberite Meetup'
---
Hello everyone! To celebrate 1000 stars on GitHub, we're arranging a meetup at a [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) in Germany. On the meetup, you will meet other people of the Cuberite community, learn how to write plugins, contribute to discussions about Cuberite's development, implement new features in Cuberite and more. There is an  [agenda](#) of things to do, but it isn't final yet. Feel free to suggest something you want to do.

The meetup will happen on February 19-21 at the address "Das Labor Alleestra√üe 50, 44793 Bochum, Germany". We will not be able to pay for accommodation, which means you'll have to find a place nearby to stay. If you're planning on visiting the meetup, please [mark off the days you will be at the meetup](http://doodle.com/poll/ywaucxvcyzstt36z), so we know how many people that are interested.
