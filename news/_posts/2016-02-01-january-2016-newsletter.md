Hi folks! This is the January 2016 edition of the Cuberite newsletter.

Last month has been all about the mobs, and when it comes to mobs, we mean wolves. Wolf taming and protection now works in Cuberite thanks to
a lot of contributions from [LogicParrot](https://github.com/LogicParrot). Also, the naming conversion is finally done thanks to contributions from [mathiascode](https://github.com/mathiascode).

We dropped the old MCServer forum in favor of a new, updated [forum](https://forum.cuberite.org/) which finally has HTTPS enabled. Don't worry, we saved all your existing data and imported it into the new forum. Now, you can find any of our services under one domain.

We matched the design of the new forum to fit the design of most of our services as well.
