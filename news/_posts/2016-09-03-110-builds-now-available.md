title: '1.10 Builds Now Available'
discussion-id: 2511

Hello there!

I am pleased to announce that builds of Cuberite supporting the 1.10 protocol revision have now been released. They are available for major platforms from the [homepage](https://cuberite.org/) and for less popular platforms from the [buildserver](https://builds.cuberite.org/).

In other news:

* Support for the 1.7 protocol has been dropped from builds
* HTTPS has been added to the majority of the Cuberite Project's web presence. This should help to improve security and reliability of the services that we provide
* New builds for odroid SBCs have been [released](https://builds.cuberite.org/job/cuberite/job/master)
* A series of fixes for crashes have been pushed by [LogicParrot](https://github.com/LogicParrot), which should improve the reliability of the server in general gameplay
