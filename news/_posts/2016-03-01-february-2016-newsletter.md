Hi again, I'm here with the Cuberite Newsletter for February of 2016!

This was quite an exciting month, with the meetup in Germany from the 19th to the 21st, where there were a range of interesting talks, and discussion about the code behind Cuberite.

The talks can be viewed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWEEhsU1Nixe3es0AUa7YkKVcAJ6wOsSo), and the discussion about the slogan is [on the forum](https://forum.cuberite.org/thread-2379.html).

There was also a discussion about whether to hold future meetups more frequently on the forum, so if you have a view please [do participate](https://forum.cuberite.org/thread-2380.html).

In other news, world travel was stabilised, so travelling between worlds is now unlikely to cause the server to crash. TLS support within Lua was also fixed.

We also got a new forum, and the URL has changed from [http://forum.mc-server.org](http://forum.mc-server.org) to [https://forum.cuberite.org](https://forum.cuberite.org). It is recommended that you change your password if you have an account there, as the new site should be more secure.

Finally, there is a new way that non-technical users can help out with the development of Cuberite - for select PRs, there are testing builds available so you can test changes before they get merged into master, and prevent game-breaking bugs for everyone else.
