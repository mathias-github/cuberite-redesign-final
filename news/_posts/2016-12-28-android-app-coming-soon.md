A few years ago, there was a possibility to run Cuberite on Android with our Android app. As development on Cuberite continued, the app was unintentionally left behind due to several issues. We are happy to announce that users will be able to run Cuberite on Android once again, by using our new and updated Android app. It is not quite ready for release yet, but we expect to have it out in the beginning of 2017.

Additionally, a few [stability issues](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/pull/3439) related to player handling have been fixed in Cuberite, thanks to [xoft](https://github.com/madmaxoft). In addition to many bug fixes and improvements, players can now use Minecraft's spectator mode without issues, and work has been started on Minecraft 1.11 support for Cuberite.
