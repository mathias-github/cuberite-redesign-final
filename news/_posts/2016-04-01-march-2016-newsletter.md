Some of our key contributors have been consumed by Factorio this month, so there hasn't been a huge amount going on. However, there have been some key improvements and bugfixes, along with multiple crash fixes:

* <a href="https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/pull/3097">#3097</a>: Players will no longer fall through unloaded chunks.
* <a href="https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/pull/3091">#3091</a>: Respawning after sleeping in a bed takes into account the world of your bed.

In other news, attachments were fixed on the forum, so all the old files are back.

As always, if you want to support future development, check us out on <a href="https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/cuberite">Bountysource</a>.
