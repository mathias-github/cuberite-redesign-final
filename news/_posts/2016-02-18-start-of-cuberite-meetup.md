Hello everyone! As mentioned in a [previous post](/news/cuberite-meetup/), the Cuberite meetup starts on Friday, February 19, 16:00 (UTC+1) at the address "Das Labor Alleestraße 50, 44793 Bochum, Germany". If you're attending the meetup, you can view the agenda [here](https://github.com/cuberite/MeetupAgenda2016). If you aren't available to meet up, you can watch a stream of the whole meetup on our [Twitch profile](https://www.twitch.tv/cuberite). You can also join our [Mumble](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page) server via the address "mumble://alkaid.uberspace.de:64999/".

Please note that we are not able to pay for accommodation, which means you’ll have to find a place to stay overnight yourself.

Hope to see you at the meetup!
