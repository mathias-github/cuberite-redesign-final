<p>Plugins are an important method of customisation for Cuberite. There are many different first and third-party plugins available in the <a href="http://forum.mc-server.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=2">plugins section</a> of our forum. For information on adding a plugin to your server, read the <a href="https://book.cuberite.org/#2.4">user's manual</a>. If you want to write your own plugin, you will find all the necessary information in the <a href="http://api-docs.cuberite.org/">API Documentation</a>.</p>
