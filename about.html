<p>Cuberite is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) Minecraft-compatible game server. Cuberite is designed with performance, configurability, and extensibility in mind, and also aims to accurately recreate most Minecraft features. The server is written in C++, and there is an extensive plugin system that allows for the user to write their own plugins with Lua.</p>

<p>Cuberite was created in late 2010 by <a href="https://github.com/faketruth">FakeTruth</a> with its original name "MCServer", as a replacement for the vanilla Minecraft server. It was soon open-sourced and developers started contributing. Today, Cuberite is maintained by a large team of <a href="https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS">contributors</a> and plugin developers.</p>
