<p>Cuberite is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) Minecraft-compatible Game Server. Cuberite is designed with performance, configurability, and extensibility in mind, and also aims to accurately recreate most vanilla features. Cuberite is written in C++, and there is an extensive plugin system that allows for the user to write their own plugins with Lua. In fact, many of the built in commands are implemented by the Core plugin, which has its own <a href="https://github.com/cuberite/Core">GitHub repository</a> and developer community.</p>

<p>Cuberite was created in late 2010 by <a href="https://github.com/faketruth">FakeTruth</a> with its original name "MCServer", as a replacement for the vanilla server. It was soon open-sourced and developers started working. Cuberite today is maintained by a large team of <a href="https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS">contributors</a> and plugin developers.</p>
