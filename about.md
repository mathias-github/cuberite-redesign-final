Cuberite is a Free and Open Source (FOSS) Minecraft-compatible game server. Cuberite is designed with performance, configurability, and extensibility in mind, and also aims to accurately recreate most vanilla features. The server is written in C++, and there is an extensive plugin system that allows for the user to write their own plugins with Lua.

Cuberite was created in late 2010 by [FakeTruth](https://github.com/faketruth) with its original name "MCServer", as a replacement for the vanilla server. It was soon open-sourced and developers started working. Today, Cuberite is maintained by a large team of [contributors](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS) and plugin developers.
